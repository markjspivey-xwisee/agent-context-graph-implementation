# AGENTS.md — Non-Negotiable Rules

These rules apply to runtime agents generated by the system (e.g., production/deployed agent teams).
They do not apply to development tooling, repository maintenance, or CI unless explicitly stated in a
dev-facing policy file.

---

## Absolute Invariants

1. **No global tool lists**
   - Agents may only act via Context Graph affordances.

2. **Affordance absence = enforcement**
   - If an action is not afforded, it must not be attempted.

3. **AAT safety is structural**
   - Never "filter" illegal actions.
   - Illegal actions must not exist in the Context Graph.

4. **Credentials are explicit**
   - Capabilities are proven via VCs only.
   - Never infer authority.

5. **Every action is traceable**
   - All traversals MUST emit a PROV trace.
   - No exceptions.

6. **Causality is external**
   - Do not embed causal reasoning in LLM logic.
   - Use references to causal semantics only.

7. **Meaning is not hard-coded**
   - Affordance labels are conventions.
   - Do not assume semantics beyond documented effects.

## Forbidden Patterns

- Hard-coded workflows
- Hidden permissions
- Silent side effects
- "Best guess" authority
- Action without provenance
- Agent deciding what it is allowed to do

---

## Definition of Done (MVP)

- Context Graph validates against schema
- SHACL shapes pass
- Golden-path example runs end-to-end
- Negative tests fail correctly
- PROV trace emitted for traversal

If any invariant is violated, the implementation is incorrect.
